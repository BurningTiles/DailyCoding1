First repeating character

Description :
You will be given a string and you have to find a character which occurs first. 
Let's take one string abdgdba, here a, b and d are repeating.
If we go left to right we can see that d is the character which repeating before other characters.
So ans will be 'd'(without quatation)
If there is no repeating characters (ex. code) then program should return -1.

Hint : 
It is guaranteed that given string will be valid and it will contain only lower case characters.

Input :
t - number of test cases
